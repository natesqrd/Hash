Traversing a list

node *p = head;
while(p->next != NULL)
p = p->next;

by setting the pointer to head, we begin at the first node in the list
to traverse we must set p to next. So long as p != NULL the pointer will move until the
last node in the section, which will be set to NULL. This is because there is no gauntee
that each node sits next to eachother in memory.
